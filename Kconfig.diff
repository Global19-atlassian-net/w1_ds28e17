+	  Say Y here if you want to use the DS28E17 1-wire-to-I2C master bridge.
+	  For each DS28E17 detected, a new I2C adapter is created within the
+	  kernel. I2C devices on that bus can be configured to be used by the
+	  kernel as on any other "native" I2C bus.
+	  
+	  In addition, that new I2C bus is accessible from userspace through
+	  a /dev/i2c-nnn device node if you have enabled
+	  "Device Drivers->I2C Support->I2C device interface" (CONFIG_I2C_CHARDEV).
+
+	  This driver is also available as a module. If so, the module 
+	  will be called w1_ds28e17.
